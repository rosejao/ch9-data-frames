# Exercise 4: external data sets: Gates Foundation Educational Grants

# Use the `read.csv()` functoin to read the data from the `data/gates_money.csv`
# file into a variable called `grants` using the `read.csv()`
# Be sure to set your working directory in RStudio, and do NOT treat strings as 
# factors!
grants <- read.csv('data/gates_money.csv', stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# Use the View function to look at the loaded data
View(grants)

# Create a variable `organization` that contains the `organization` column of 
# the dataset
organization <- grants$organization

# Confirm that the "organization" column is a vector using the `is.vector()` 
# function. 
# This is a useful debugging tip if you hit errors later!
is.vector('organization')

## Now you can ask some interesting questions about the dataset

# What was the mean grant value?
mean_spending <- mean(grants$total_amount)

# What was the dollar amount of the largest grant?
max_spending <- max(grants$total_amount)

# What was the dollar amount of the smallest grant?
min_spending <- min(grants$total_amount)

# Which organization received the largest grant?
largest_recipient <- organization[grants$total_amount == max_spending]

# Which organization received the smallest grant?
smallest_recipient <- organization[grants$total_amount == min_spending]

# How many grants were awarded in 2010?
length(grants$total_amount[grants$start_year == 2010])
